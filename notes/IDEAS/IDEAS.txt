GENERAL IDEA:

	Gameplay surrounds player beginning with overwhelming powers and actions that cannot be undone.
	Story branches based on actions taken, and player may attack/kill whomever they like. 
	YOUR. ACTIONS. MEAN. SOMETHING. 
	
	Story begins at the start of life for Android player, where some misfire occurs of some sort,
	and a human is killed. It is a traumatic experience, but your creator(s) assure you in spite 
	of all the backlash, that this misfortune was not your fault. This used to illustrate the 
	importance and finality of player's actions. Will be reinforced somehow in this beginning stage
	to the point that it is very clear to the person playing the game that there are undoable actions 
	that have very real consequences in the world. 
	
	Story will progress and there will be characters whose powers 
	are on the player's level, but low level/power NPCs will still exist in this same world. 
	
		* Like in GBC LoZ games, where different mounts have different powers and dialogue/story 
		associated with them, there can exist many paths by which you can achieve certain goals,
		like the following simplified pathing for the over arching story:
		
		
		(***)   (***)    [Possible Endings of Chapter/Specific story)
		/ \       / \
	   /  \      /   \
	 (*)  (*)  (*)  (*)  [Different pre-Ending setups that can lead to the same, or different Endings]
	 \    \     /   /
	   \  \   /   /
	     \ \ /  /
		  (****)         [Initial starting point for chapter/story element]
		  
	
		* The "pre-Ending" section in the middle may represent three different characters/objectives
		that may assist you or lead you to the next level/layer/step towards the ending of the 
		chapter/story/side-objective at hand. 
			
			---These different "pre-Endings" can exist such that at least one of them cannot be failed,
			so in the event the player behaves/acts in a way that makes all other paths to 
			a **NECESSARY** goal unusable, the main plot can be pushed along to a next step, whether 
			to the benefit or detriment to the player.

	4 different elemental powers where player effectively takes the form of 1 of 4 elements at a time
	(potentially a comination of them in the future) and has powers and behaviors specific for each 
	element. Can equip two at a time in one of two element slots, but in the start they are used 
	independently:
	
		1. Air - can become visible blowing gust of wind that darts in a certain direction. Acts
		similar to a quick dash, and while moving like this, player cannot be harmed. Used as a dodge or
		as a way to cross small gaps otherwise could not pass.
		2. Earth - sd
