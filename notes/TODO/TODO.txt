1. Reference ace.SR project for entrance triggers. 
	Rework and simplify.
	
DONE! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx DONE!

6/16/25:
1. Reference ace.SR project and figure out why collisions do not work properly after
	pressing an action button. Right now, collisions work, and then after action press, 
	upon collision detection, player stutters as if collision is detected, and then 
	immediately disregarded, so instead of stopping player movement, collision detection 
	just causes stutter in movement.
	
DONE! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx DONE!

		**** made sure to reset sprite_mask after changing it to 
		corresponding hitbox sprite for the attack being used

6/17/25:
1. Create save and load behavior such that when a room is exited
	and re-entered, items do not respawn if not meant to. Compare with
	Ace.SR and also research other methods of saving rooms, and how this 
	works alongside creating save game files for saving and loading entire
	game. Need to save rooms individually, and also save whole game.
	
	-*-*-*-::: Consult the same save/load video series from before to rewrite save load system
